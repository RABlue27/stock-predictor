# stock-predictor
Simple ML code to predict the price of a stock tomorrow. 

Program to try to predict the price of a stock ticker the next day. Uses historical data to estimate future data. 
Currently working to improve usability.

# This isn't supposed to predict the future 
It only uses previous close prices! No volume / extramarket activites are taken into account 
Although I should probably add volume to the data
